# Unit Project 3: Project 2 Update and Business Application
*Due April 8, 2015.  Brief presentations in class.*

### After the project, you will be able to:

### Contents of your submission include

* Presentation
* "Client-Facing" Notebook

#### Presentation

Each student will have a maximum of 10 minutes to present their project. Presentation industry standards usually include PowerPoint presentations, so spend a little time putting together a relatively short deck (~10 or so slides) that go into the details of your final project. Consider your audience a business group and your fellow data team; feel free to include the math, but don't bore your CEO :).

A good presentation will **at least** include the following:

1. Motivation: Introduce the project and what you were trying to accomplish
2. Data summary: what is it, where did it come from? Consider making a data dictionary. Include visualizations.
3. Initial approach: what was your hypothesis, and the approach you decided to take to get there?
4. Successes and Challenges: What worked well with your above reproach? What didn't? How did this director your analysis and machine learning approach? Include visuals to help explain these.
5. Additional refactoring, iterations, etc that you cycled through to.
6. Conclusions
7. Business Gain
8. Next steps (no project is ever finished!)

#### Client-Facing Notebook (The "paper")

A clean notebook notebook with text, code and images which could be understood by a reader such as yourself prior to taking this course.  Include as many images as you can, provided you include a brief explanation of them or they are self explanatory.  Feel free to include code, but ensure that it is explained, _briefly_, via text.  A good ratio to consider would be 1:1 for code to everything else. Use previous projects and the feedback provided as a guideline.

Include the following sections:

##### Motivation

* A paragraph or two describing in words what the work you're describing.
* Feel free to include any images or plots that help.

##### Data Summary
* How did you acquire and clean the data?
* How did you describe your dataset?  Include all exploratory plots.  What was interesting about it?

### Analyses Performed

#### Analysis 1

* Question Asked
* Analysis Performed
* Explanation of Analysis
* Results
* Explanation of Results

#### Analysis 2 (etc.)

### Conclusions

Recap the motivation and overall results

### Next Steps

What are some follow up analyses that might be interesting?
