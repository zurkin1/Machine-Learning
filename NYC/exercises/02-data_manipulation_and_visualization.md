# Data Manipulation and Visualization
*Due Date: 2/9/2015*

### Description
In the `data` folder you'll find included the file `bikeshare.csv`. This file contains data related to number of riders (casual, members, and total) for each hour, compared to stats for that time, such as temperature, windspeed. the file `bikeshare.txt` will explain it in more detail.

Your goals:
* Explore the data in both hourly and daily counts. You'll need to aggregate by day to generate the daily data.
* Visualise the relationships between the ridership and different features.
* Explain which features seem to be the strongest indicators for each type of ridership (casual and noncasual). Do certain features come off as better tells for one over the other?
* Summarise your results.
* **Extra**: Business application. Given this information, what suggestions could be made to improve the ridership program? Consider this open field, since we only have aggregated stats and not individual ridership here.

### What's due
* A notebook that goes through the data exploration model;
    * acquires and imports the data
    * cleans it up (create the daily from the hourly)
    * explores the two data sets for patterns
    * summarises and explains the results

Please upload this notebook to your github (the `.ipynb` file), or copy and paste the file's contents into a gist.

### What we're measuring
* Cleanliness: how approachable is this notebook? Does it feel organized?
* Visualisations vs explaination: how accurately can you explain the visuals you generate? How well do they capture the story about the data?
